title: Virtual Hosting
desc: This module implements virtual hosting facilities for Phorum. It extends the vroot functionality of Phorum, so it is possible to bind a certain website hostname to a specific vroot. This way, multiple websites can have their own Phorum vroot on their own site, looking like it were a separate Phorum installation. There are also some extra's to make vroots / virtual hosts more versatile.
