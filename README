Module  : Virtual Hosting
Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module implements virtual hosting facilities for Phorum.
It extends the vroot functionality of Phorum, so it is possible to bind
a certain website hostname to a specific vroot. This way, multiple
websites can have their own Phorum vroot on their own site, looking like
it were a separate Phorum installation. There are also some extra's to
make vroots / virtual hosts more versatile.

For running this module, Phorum 5.1.21 or higher is required.

The initial development of this module was genrously sponsored by
Phorum users MarkFresh and rheo. Thanks a lot guys!

  hosting to your vroots.
