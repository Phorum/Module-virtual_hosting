2007-07-11 v1.0.1

    - Fixed a bug: when deleting a vroot which still had hostnames linked
      to it, the hostnames would not get unlinked. This resulted in some
      stale hostnames which could not be deleted through the interface
      (thanks to David Scott for reporting the bug).

2007-03-08 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
